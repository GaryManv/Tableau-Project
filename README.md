# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
To generate visualizations using the given data, identify patterns, present data and give suggestions.

## Process

### step1.Downloaded datasets as per instructions

### Step2.Created a graph for house prices and trend line for it.
### Result2. Prices for houses trending to decrease

### Step3.Compared the trend after 2005 with actual benchmark prices in table real_estate_prices. 
### Result3. Predictions are exactly opposite: instead of house price drop the continiusly increase

### Step4. Compared houses trend with the trend of office prices.
### Result4. Office prices hiking while house prices go down.

### Step5.  Created a heatmap of Canada with current house prices for each available district. 
### Result5. Started with default heat map but result didn't give any insights. Desided to switched to symbol map. Get more clear and undersandable picture of house prices in Canada.Interesting fact for investigation : houses in prieries are more expensive than houses in west and east costs: which is definitely wrong.

### Step6. Compared the trend of house prices with earnings. 
### Result6. While house prices constantly go down the earning constantly go up.

### Step7. Did people spend more of their earnings in 2014 than they did in 2001?
### Result7.People start spend approximately twice less after 2006

### Step8. - There were several economic crises in the world in the last 40 years, including these four: Black Monday (1987), Recession (early 1990s), dot com bubble (2000 - 2002), Financial crisis (2007 - 2009). Show the effect of these crises on:

###  - Earnings (no effect on ernings, which is strange as profit goes down, layoffs and bussiness closures. Need further investigation on earning data.)
###  - House prices (1987 and early 1990s - no effect, continue move up; 2000-2002 - prices fall down on 1998 and keep falling down with slight encreasys during the way. Can suppose that house market was predicting crisis 2 year before dot.com bubble crisis. House prices drop down 1 year before the 4th financial crisis.
###  - Office prices (1987 prices started moving up from a steady status, in 1990 slightly went down but came back to 1990 level in 1995 and continue to slowly grow up, during dot com bubble office prices continue move up; Strange thing during the crisis office prices were still going up and right after crisis show slight decline in 2009 which was fully recovered in 2011. Probably investors start buying offices considering it as a stable asset. Also it's possible that leasies for offices are long term which attract investors 
###  - House constructions
###    - Consumer index

### Step9.- Plot consumer_index together with housing_price_index and fit the regression line between them. Can we predict consumer_index from the housing_price_index?
to be able to use scatter plot used joined tables, otherwise can't unable aggregated values.
transact measures to categorical values"
Cunsomer values are :from 66 to 16214 
My Categories for consumers : 
very low index = 0-3000
low index = 3001-6000
medium index = 6001-10000
high index = 10001-13000
very high = 13001-16214

House indeces values are between 409 to 10589
My Categories for houses :
very low index = 0-2200
low index = 2201-4400
medium index = 4401-6600
high index = 6601-8800
very high = 8801-11000
## Results9 : Couldn't finish

## Challenges 
Wrong/messy data : Wrong house_price_index file (duplicate with consumer_index), no clear description of json file, changing geographical names

## Future Goals
Improve knowledge in Tableau
